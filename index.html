  <h1>Using paper</h1>
  <p>in around october 2020 i sent out envelopes to some people who were interested (and others who did not have a say in the matter) that contained an a5 piece of paper, a short instruction card and a stamped return envelope to myself. the instuctions said for the recipient to do something with the paper and send it back to me to (eventually) collate. below are the 16 i got back over the following months.</p>
  <p>each page has been scanned only on the side presumed to be the one of interest, and is oriented in the presumed correct way. any other notes on the pages including content on the side not scanned are underneath.</p>
