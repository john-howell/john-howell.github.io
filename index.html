  <h1>Using paper</h1>
  <p>in around october 2020 i sent out envelopes to some people who were interested (and others who did not have a say in the matter) that contained an a5 piece of paper, a short instruction card and a stamped return envelope to myself. the instuctions said for the recipient to do something with the paper and send it back to me to (eventually) collate. below are the 16 i got back over the following months.</p>
  <p>each page has been scanned only on the side presumed to be the one of greater interest, and is oriented in the presumed intended way. other notes about the pages are underneath where needed. the images are very big so youll have to zoom out, i didn't want to lower the resolution on them.</p>

  <p>intended orientation for this is up to interpretation </p>

  <p>unscanned side has presumably the first attempt at the scanned side scribbled out with the writing "Don't include this side, for the love of god" underneath</p>

  <p>this page was folded down the middle to make a card. unscanned side is the writing in the card containing an expression of the writer's boredom and their well-wishes toward myself</p>
  <br>
  <img src="images/up16-1.png">
  <p>this page was photographed rather than scanned due to the plastic baby glued to the front of it. unscanned side has credits to the 3 artists behind the page</p>
